# MAFF2023
Pre-simulation for SWISSfoodsys

Build 2.3 Feb 16 2025

Simultaneous simulation for croping and animal production models with 16 crops, 6 processing foods,
13 feeds, 7 livestocks, 5 animal products and 2 marine products.
The objective function consists of calorie deficit and food intake balance of 8 food groups.
The contstraints on cropping are arable land endowments by total acreage and month, and expansion margin for each crop.
The contstraints on livestock production are total feed supply and TDN and CP balance.
Besides baseline scenario (no food and feed import), optional import decline scenario is avialable.
