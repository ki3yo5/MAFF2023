Pre-simulation for DSS-ESSA

Build 1.1 Dec 12 2023

Cropping model with 16 crops but without livestock and processing foods.
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance only.
Contstraints on pooled land size and 250% margin for each cropiing area.
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for the total population per day.

Build 1.0

Simple model with 7 crops and calorie and PCF balance only.
Contstraints on land size (1ha) only.
Nutrient balance per day per family (4 adults) is optimized.
